Lecture 10
==========

Working in a new IPython Notebook, use `NCBI EUtils <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/>`_, `urllib2 <http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html>`_, `xml.etree.ElementTree <http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html>`_ and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ to do the following:

1. Retrieve the number of articles in *Nature* on lung cancer in 2000.
2. Modify the code used to achieve the above to create a loop, and get the list of counts of articles in *Nature* on lung cancer between 1990 and 2014. Print this to the terminal as tab-separated text.
3. Plot this to visualize the trend. 
4. Generalize this, so a user can enter an arbitrary search term (so instead of *lung cancer*, they can enter another phrase).

Lecture 9
=========

Function definition exercise
----------------------------

Run through Exercise 1 from `today's notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/blob/master/programming-and-se/4-functions.ipynb>`_.

For more practice: adapt your "sequence processor" script to use functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define a couple of functions in your sequence processor script. One of these could be called ``compute_gc_content``, and another could be called ``compute_length``. Each of these should take a single sequence as input, and return the GC content or the sequence length, respectively, as output. Hook these functions up so they are called when the user defines what function they want to run.

File I/O: adapt your "sequence processor" script to read and write files
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of passing a sequence on the command line, pass a file with one sequence per line. Have your script perform the requested function on all sequences in the file and print the results to the terminal. Once that's working, have your script take an output file name as another command line parameter. Instead of printing output to the screen, have your command write the result for each sequence to the specified file.

Paste the following sequences into a new text file to pass as input to your script::

	ACCGGT
	GTTGACCAGGTTGACACCGTTGACACA
	GGTCCAGGTTGACCA
	ACCGATTTTAAA

Lecture 8

Continue working on your "sequence processor" script
----------------------------------------------------

See description under Lecture 7.

Lecture 7
=========

Write a python `Hello World` script
-----------------------------------

In your Unix/Linux/OS X environment of choice (koding.com, QIIME VB, laptop), write a program called ``hello_world.py`` that when run prints the text ``Hello World!`` to the terminal. You should be able to call this script from anywhere like:

	hello_world.py

.. hint:: Don't forget the *shebang* line. For python scripts, this should look like ``#!/usr/bin/env python``.

Create a "sequence processor" script
------------------------------------

Define a new script called ``sequence_processor.py``. This script should take two arguments on the command line, a function and a sequence, and output the results of applying the specified function to the sequence. Be creative in what functions you support (but some ideas are ``compute-length`` and ``compute-gc-content``). Add a ``help`` function which prints out some information on how to use your script and what functions it supports.

.. hint:: Use ``argv`` to load command line arguments. To do this, you'll need to include the line ``from sys import argv`` toward the top of your script.

You can use the following as a starting point for this::

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	from sys import argv

	if len(argv) == 3:
	   print "The name of the script is: ", argv[0]
	   print "The first argument is: ", argv[1]
	   print "The second argument is: ", argv[2]
	else:
	   print "ERROR: sequence_processor.py must be called with exactly two arguments!"

My ``sequence-processor.py`` script looks like the following::

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	from __future__ import division
	from sys import argv

	script_name = argv[0]
	sequence = argv[1]
	function = argv[2]

	if len(argv) == 3:
	    print "The name of the script is: ", script_name
	    print "The sequence is: ", sequence
	    print "The function to perform is: ", function
	else:
	    print "ERROR: sequence_processor.py must be called with exactly two arguments!"

	if function == "length":
	  print len(sequence)
	elif function == "gc-content":
	  print (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence)
	elif function == "validate":
	  total_acgt_count = sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C') + sequence.count('A') + sequence.count('T')
	  if total_acgt_count == len(sequence):
	    print "Sequence is valid (it only contains As, Cs, Gs and Ts)."
	  else:
	    print "Sequence is invalid (it contains characters other than As, Cs, Gs, and Ts)."
	else:
	  print "ERROR: Unknown function!"



Lecture 6
=========

Working with the python interpreter
-----------------------------------

Run the command ``python`` to open the python interpreter. 

Define a variable ``a`` as some integer, and add a number to it. 

Define a variable ``b`` as some integer, and add it to ``a``. 

Multiply and divide ``a`` and ``b``. When do you and do you not get the expected results? 

Set a variable ``c`` as the result of some operation between ``a`` and ``b``. 

Define a variable ``d`` as a real (i.e., floating point) number. Perform the same operations as above, using ``d`` in place of ``a`` or ``b``. What is the same and what is different about the results. 

Print a string to the screen.


Lecture 5
=========

Make your script developed in class last time executable from anywhere on the system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will involve changing permissions using chmod, setting your ``PATH`` environment variable with ``export``, and adding that export command to your ``$HOME/.bashrc`` script.

You can do this as follows::
	
	mkdir $HOME/scripts
	echo "" >> $HOME/.bashrc
	echo "export PATH=$HOME/scripts:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc

You'll then need to open a new terminal window so ``$HOME/.bashrc`` is executed (and your ``$PATH`` variable gets set). You can then copy your script into ``$HOME/scripts``, and you should be able to run it from anywhere on the system.

Configure ftp in your coding account
------------------------------------

See the instructions `here <http://learn.koding.com/setting-up-ftp-on-koding/>`_. 

Lecture 4
=========

Using ``grep`` and navigating directories
-----------------------------------------
Download the Greengenes 13_8 OTUs subset from `here <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a0coxo8zkw6qz63/gg_13_8_otus_sub.tgz>`_ using curl. Untar/zip the file (hint: use ``tar -xzvf``), and change to the resulting directory. Under this directory, there is another directory called ``rep_set`` which contains several fasta files. How do you get ``grep`` to print the number of lines in a file rather than the lines which match a pattern? How many sequence records are in the ``97``, ``88``, and ``73`` variants of those files?

Writing a first shell script
----------------------------
Create a new file called ``my_script.sh`` with ``nano`` and enter the following text::
	
	#!/bin/bash
	echo "Below are contents of the directory:"
	pwd
	ls -al
	echo "The time is currently:"
	date

Now change the permissions on this file to give it execute permissions::

	chmod u+x my_script.sh

Then execute this by running::

	./my_script.sh

This exercise is derived from *Practical Computing for Biologists*

Write a more useful shell script
--------------------------------

Write a new shell script that tells you the number of records in a fasta file, if you provide a path to a fasta file on the command line. Hint: If you pass argument(s) to your script, you can access those within the script as ``$1``, ``$2``, .... 

Lecture 3
=========

Create a koding account
-----------------------

.. note::
	If you want e-mail updates on NAU's Linux cluster (and other local "big data" topics), see `here <http://caporasolab.us/teaching/#keeping-up-to-date-on-bioinformatics-at-nau>`_.

Go `here <https://koding.com/R/gregcaporaso>`_ to create a new account at koding.com. Boot up a virtual machine, and open the terminal.

The remaining exercises will be performed in your koding.com virtual machine. 

Using ``curl`` and ``grep``
---------------------------
Download the EMP minimal mapping file, directly into your AWS instance, from `here <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f7ysoltbn0zpah7/e
mp_11sept2012_minimal_mapping_file.txt.gz>`_ using ``curl``. You'll need to unzip that file with ``gunzip`` to get started. You can read about the `file format here <http://qiime.org/documentation/file_formats.html#metadata-mapping-files>`_.

How do you perform a search with ``grep``? How do you invert a search with ``grep``?  How can you print the lines that contain information on human-associated samples? How can you print the lines that contain information on non-human-associated samples?

Lecture 2
=========

Working with regular expressions
--------------------------------

Download `this file <https://www.dropbox.com/s/m21r7l91al1k0nt/Lecture2_support.zip>`_ and unzip it. Work through the examples presented in the lecture slides.

Lecture 1
=========

Studying genomes
----------------

Download a bacterial or archaeal genome (I suggest starting at `IMG <http://img.jgi.doe.gov/w/>`_, but whatever source you're comfortable with is fine), find a gene in that genome, and determine the function of that gene.
